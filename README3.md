## Principles of UX/UI Design

> *User stories:* _As a (type of user), I want (a goal) for (some reason)_

* Type of user: This is the end-user or the user's role in the application software. For example: _"As an online banking customer."_
* A goal: This is the action taken by the user on the application software. For example: _"I want to add a payee to my account."_
* Some reason: - The outcome or desired value the user expects from the action performed. For example: _"so that I can transfer money to the payee."_

*The user story is:*
_"As an online banking customer, I want to add a payee to my account, so I can transfer money to the payee."_

### Five stages of the UX process

1. Emphatize: The key here is to understand your user’s needs using research.
2. Define: Identify your users’ critical problems
3. Ideate: Generate ideas by sketching, brainstorming, mind-mapping, and even creating hand-written notes
4. Prototype: Simulate how your product will work before release
5. Test: Users interact with or test your prototype. Any problems are communicated, and you can then address these issues before building the final product. This is an iterative process

### Jakob Nielsen's usability components

1. Learnability: The product should immediately be easy to understand and learn
2. Efficiency: The product should act quickly and efficiently should the user choose to make changes while using your product
3. Memorability: The product should be designed so that if the user gets distracted, it should be easy to remember where they were
4. Errors: The design should provide solutions to mistakes and try to prevent them from happening
5. Satisfaction: Users should enjoy using your product, and you should keep them engaged and excited

|*Typography elements*||
|Baseline|The point at which the text line rests|
|Cap height|Refers to the height of the capital letters|
|X-Height|Also known as corpus size, is the distance between the lowercase "x baseline" and meanline|
|Ascenders and descenders|It's a part of a letter that extends above the x-height or cap height, such as the stem of a lowercase b or d|
|Weight|The overall thickness of a typeface's stroke|
|Tracking|It's the spacing between all a font's characters|
|Kerning|The space that exists between two specific letters|
|Leading|The space between two lines of text|
|White space|It refers to the space between blocks of text|
|Stroke|A straight or curved line forms the main body of a letter|
|Serif|A stroke or foot-like element is connected to the end of the main strokes of some typefaces|
|Sans serif|A typeface that does not have any strokes or extra elements at the bottom of a letter|
|*Types of Grids*||
|Block grids|The simplest grid structure, a large rectangular area taking up most of the space inside a format|
|Column grid: divided-yet-equal|Composed of several columns, primarily used to organize multiple elements into columns|
|Modular grid: perfect symmetry|Presents multiple items simultaneously for easy access when multiple elements are organized in web design|
|Hierarchical grids|Described as "freestyle," whose elements are placed "spontaneously" among the grid's columns and rows|
|Baseline grids|Baseline grids are used to set the leading from one line of text to the next for consistency|

### The Rapid Prototyping Cycle
1. The first step is to create what you are testing
2. Test it on users, stakeholders, or your team and make changes based on their feedback
3. Repeat the procedure
