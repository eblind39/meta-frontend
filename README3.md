## Principles of UX/UI Design

> *User stories:* _As a (type of user), I want (a goal) for (some reason)_

* Type of user: This is the end-user or the user's role in the application software. For example: _"As an online banking customer."_
* A goal: This is the action taken by the user on the application software. For example: _"I want to add a payee to my account."_
* Some reason: - The outcome or desired value the user expects from the action performed. For example: _"so that I can transfer money to the payee."_

*The user story is:*
_"As an online banking customer, I want to add a payee to my account, so I can transfer money to the payee."_

### Five stages of the UX process

1. Emphatize: The key here is to understand your user’s needs using research.
2. Define: Identify your users’ critical problems
3. Ideate: Generate ideas by sketching, brainstorming, mind-mapping, and even creating hand-written notes
4. Prototype: Simulate how your product will work before release
5. Test: Users interact with or test your prototype. Any problems are communicated, and you can then address these issues before building the final product. This is an iterative process

### Jakob Nielsen's usability components

1. Learnability: The product should immediately be easy to understand and learn
2. Efficiency: The product should act quickly and efficiently should the user choose to make changes while using your product
3. Memorability: The product should be designed so that if the user gets distracted, it should be easy to remember where they were
4. Errors: The design should provide solutions to mistakes and try to prevent them from happening
5. Satisfaction: Users should enjoy using your product, and you should keep them engaged and excited

|*Typography elements*||
|Baseline|The point at which the text line rests|
|Cap height|Refers to the height of the capital letters|
|X-Height|Also known as corpus size, is the distance between the lowercase "x baseline" and meanline|
|Ascenders and descenders|It's a part of a letter that extends above the x-height or cap height, such as the stem of a lowercase b or d|
|Weight|The overall thickness of a typeface's stroke|
|Tracking|It's the spacing between all a font's characters|

|*Types of Grids*||
|Block grids|The simplest grid structure, a large rectangular area taking up most of the space inside a format|
|Column grid: divided-yet-equal|Composed of several columns, primarily used to organize multiple elements into columns|
|Modular grid: perfect symmetry|Presents multiple items simultaneously for easy access when multiple elements are organized in web design|
|Hierarchical grids|Described as "freestyle," whose elements are placed "spontaneously" among the grid's columns and rows|
|Baseline grids|Baseline grids are used to set the leading from one line of text to the next for consistency|
