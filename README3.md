## Principles of UX/UI Design

> *User stories:* _As a (type of user), I want (a goal) for (some reason)_

* Type of user: This is the end-user or the user's role in the application software. For example: _"As an online banking customer."_

* A goal: This is the action taken by the user on the application software. For example: _"I want to add a payee to my account."_

* Some reason: - The outcome or desired value the user expects from the action performed. For example: _"so that I can transfer money to the payee."_

*The user story is:*
_"As an online banking customer, I want to add a payee to my account, so I can transfer money to the payee."_

### Five stages of the UX process

1. Emphatize: The key here is to understand your user’s needs using research.
2. Define: Identify your users’ critical problems
3. Ideate: Generate ideas by sketching, brainstorming, mind-mapping, and even creating hand-written notes
4. Prototype: Simulate how your product will work before release
5. Test: Users interact with or test your prototype. Any problems are communicated, and you can then address these issues before building the final product. This is an iterative process

### Jakob Nielsen's usability components

1. Learnability: The product should immediately be easy to understand and learn
2. Efficiency: The product should act quickly and efficiently should the user choose to make changes while using your product
3. Memorability: The product should be designed so that if the user gets distracted, it should be easy to remember where they were
4. Errors: The design should provide solutions to mistakes and try to prevent them from happening
5. Satisfaction: Users should enjoy using your product, and you should keep them engaged and excited
