### First-class functions
They are “first-class citizens”. What does that mean?
* pass to other functions
* save in a variable
* return from other functions

### Higher-order functions
* It accepts other functions as arguments
* It returns functions when invoked

### Pure functions and side-effects
* A pure function returns the exact same result as long as it's given the same values
* It should not have side-effects. A side-effect is any instance where a function makes a change outside of itself
